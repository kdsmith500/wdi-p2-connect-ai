connect-ai

This is a WIP and the MVP is launched on:

https://connect-ai-app.herokuapp.com/

The goal of this app is to provide a playground for Google's Deep AI software apis. Users are given a forum where they can create threads composed of images and text and reply to those threads as well. The Deep AI will be selectable from either the nav bar or an aside and then used to manipulate text and images on the page.

State of connect-ai:

Currently the site is a working image board. Login with Google+ and share used the new threads page.

ICEBOX:

All Deep AI features need to be implemented. Replies to threads is not yet implemented. User pages do not show thread information yet and thread pages do not show user information yet.

Wireframes:

Navigate to the wireframes directory in the repo.
